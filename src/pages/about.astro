			I'm UK-based, balancing my studies with my hobbies and life in general. I'm a huge fan of most
			things AI/ML, and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow in the field. I'm also a
			huge fan of video games - been playing <a

			since 2011, and I've been hooked on it ever since. I also play a good amount of

			"Kesku" is a nickname I've had since I was 15, and it's stuck with me since then.

		<p>It's actually an acronym:</p>

			<li><strong>E</strong>verything</li>

			When I say "Keep Understanding", I mean to keep things simple for others to understand. I
			believe that the best way to learn is to teach, so that's kind of what I'm doing here.
			Hopefully, I'm doing this in a way that's easy to understand - but.. probably not. I'm still
			learning, after all.

			Nothing really. Actually, <strong>why are you even here?</strong> I'm just a student who likes
			to write about random stuff. I’m not claiming to be a polished writer—far from it. I’m just here
			to share my experiences learning, my thoughts on the tech industry, and maybe some tutorials here
			and there. Going over some arxiv papers sounds fun too. I'm not sure yet, but I'm sure I'll figure
			it out as I go along. I hope you enjoy your stay here, and if you have any feedback, feel free
			to reach out to me. I'm always looking to improve.
